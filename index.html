    <p>
      I recently graduated with a master's degree in Computer Science from Sorbonne University.
      I chose to work in the data engineering area and got my first tech job experience as a Big Data Engineer
      intern at Thales. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time I code, make projects and learn new things to expand my skills and knowledge.
      You will find the projects on my GitHub profile :)
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from that, I do a lot of sports. I switch between strength training, biking, running and hiking.
      I would also like to discover climbing very soon.

<!-- Why data engineering -->

    <h5 class="ws-center ws-padding-64 aboutme"><span class="ws-tag ws-wide">Why Data Engineering ?</span></h5>
    <p>
      Data Engineers play an important role in a company as they provide ready-to-use data to Data Scientists and
      Analysts to make their jobs easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really like using different Big Data technos to build data pipelines that will transform raw data into 
      useful information for decision makers or into valuable data for Data Scientists.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like working with data but I also like software engineering. Data engineering mix them perfectly together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data engineering field has so many technologies that their engineers will always have something new to learn.
      It is very exciting to learn new things everyday.
