    <p>
      I recently graduated with a master's degree in Computer Science from Sorbonne University.
      I chose to work in the data engineering area and got my first tech job experience as a Big Data Engineer
      intern at Thales. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time I code, make projects and learn new things to expand my skills and knowledge.
    </br>
      Feel free to take a look at the projects on my GitHub profile :)
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from that, I do a lot of sports. I switch between strength training, biking, running and hiking.
      I would also like to discover climbing very soon.

<!-- Why did I choose data engineering -->
<div class="ws-container" id="about">
  <div class="ws-content" style="max-width:700px">
    <h5 class="ws-center ws-padding-64 aboutme"><span class="ws-tag ws-wide">Why did I choose Data Engineering ?</span></h5>
    <p>
      I chose the Data Engineering area because it is a fast changing field with a ton of new things to discover and learn everyday. 
      Using tools and applying concepts to transform incoming data into useful information for data scientists and 
      decision makers.
      Data engineers stand with an important role as they provide clean data to people in the data team.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also interested in software engineering which is perfect as data engineers will need coding skills to set up transformation pipelines and platforms. 
      I think that a data engineer with software engineering skills is even more valuable.

<!-- What am I looking for -->

  <div class="ws-content" style="max-width:700px">
    <h5 class="ws-center ws-padding-64 aboutme"><span class="ws-tag ws-wide">What am I looking for ?</span></h5>
    <p>
      I am looking for a position where I can do what I really want to do, typically what data or software engineers do. 
      I want to work on great projects with challenging tasks that will help me to grow and develop my experience. </br>
      I donâ€™t want to spend a day without learning new things, expanding my knowledge, 
      so this is important to me to find a position where I can learn everyday. </br>
      The last thing is obvious but having a good working atmosphere and getting along well with co-workers are essential.
